      <h1>The Final Apology Letter</h1>
    <p> 
      Kashish, I know things havent been going alright between us, 
      I mean weve broken up what can be worse than this. 
      I know there have been a lot of problems lately, I mean not lately since quite a time now, but you know 
      Kashish see there are problems I agree, there were problems and there will always be problems,
      there is no end to it. Why? cuz that's how relationships are, problems are a part of relationships Kashish.
      Even the most perfect relationship have problems, every relationship has problems and misunderstandings, 
      but Kashish we work them out leaving is not the solution cuz even if you get into a new relationship with someone else
      there will be problems there too, if problems are gonna remain as it is despite the person 
      then why dont we work this out with the same person why do we have to lose eachother.

      ghumaoing hath on your sarr, thinking youre so cute and so fucking pretty or when you were tying your shoelace
      and I pulled you for a kiss or trek wale din and so many more yaar, no one else has seen those moments,
      no one else has lived those moments, its us, you and me, only and only us, who have lived all of those moments
      and only we know what we shared in those moments. I know our problems are real, I agree we had problems and they are real
      but answer me Kashish, werent these moments real? wasnt this happiness real? wasnt that love real and pure?
      we had problems we did but why do have to lose all the good things too to get rid of the problems
      when we can sit and work it out and get rid of the problems, beleive me we can, we really can work this out.
      Kashish, we are gonna end it... all of it.. do you know big that is.. well lose everything, 
      like everything weve had, all the love, all the kisses, all the holding hands, all the flowers, the random chocolates,

      so many things are still left yaar, i wanna do so many things with you. Please Kashish lets not end this please please please
      lets just give each other one last chance. I dont wanna lose you because you mean so much to me like so so so much to me,
      the way youve treated me, no one like sachmein no one not even strawberry treated me vaise, the way you made me feel wanted,
      the way you made me feel prioritized, the way you made me feel important, no one else has ever made me feel like that,
      hamesha since bachpan I was alone hi, like I did have friends, but they werent friends friends yk only school me talking kinda freinds,
      i had no one, I hated my parents, they probably hated me too I think, I always wanted someone but i never had anyone,
      like everyone around me had someone a friend, a partner, a bestie, or atleast parents, whom they could talk to, tell them how they feel, about their day,
      about anythings, they had friends to play with, I always loved to play sports yk but I had no one mere building me sirf ladkiyan that too mere se choti
      I had to play with them bache wale games cuz no choice, I just hated being ghar pe since bachpan yk, I just hated my ghar but I had no other option. 
      The loneliness plus the suffocation at ghar, the constant yelling at ghar, everything I just hated everything,
      I just wanted to be loved by someone,I remember bachpan me crying cuz I wanted to have someone to talk to, someone who understood me,
      someone who loved me, my presence mattered to no one, not even my friends.This happened for years and then
      Someone very Pretty ladki comes in my life and changes everything, and suddenly she wants me all the time,
      she doesnt go out if I dont come, my presence finally mattered to someone, I was special to someone atleast,
      I loved everything, the way you treated me,I finally felt wanted and loved.Sachmein,Kashish all of this matters to me 
      a lot, the way you treated me, the way you treat me everything.Honestly, I beleive you are the best girl I could ever get
      I kya the best girl anyone could ever get, Like You've done so much for me, you always paid for me like honestly tell me which ladki
      does that aaj kal, who pays for thier poor loser bf but you did and you never even complained or said anything about it
      or made me feel like poor or like a loser for making you pay, you never even asked for expensive gifts, expensive kya
      you never asked for gifts like other ladkiyan, and the way you got happy like sach wala happy when i gave you chotu si 10rs wali chocolate,
      like no other ladki does that, they be like, how poor my bf is cant even give me acha chocolate and they sachmein leave the ladka,
      but you didnt do that ever like sachmein I dont think any other ladki in the world would get so happy if I gave her 10rs ki chocolate.
      Also, you hamehsa understood about my parents, and how they grounded me so even tho you wanted to go bahar more often,
      more time tak you adjusted on that too and adjusted according to my stupid timings like Juhu in the morning like even tho you knew
      you'll die dhoop me, you still came and never complained about it, Like no other ladki would ever do that yk.
      Also the way you are like So fucking Pretty ???? ikdam like yk soft wala pretty, like I mean like ikdam 
      yk like gentle,delicate,warm,elegant,effortless kinda pretty, ikdam classy and elegant yk,like ikdam soft and squishy,

      Alright, I know Kashish things have been going really bad rn but beleive me Kashish we are a great couple sachmein
      See, I know we've been fighting a lot and argueing a lot but yk just think about it all our problems were
      mainly due to lack of communication yk, we just needed a proper deep conversation about all the things
      and try to understand each other in a better way.Kashish we have problems but to get rid of those problems, 
      is ending the only solution.The truth is you khud dont want it to end, I know it you know it too, 
      I know the only problem here is my gussa I know like I know you are leaving because of my gussa hi and you 
      did give me time too to change but I didnt do anything I know. I think I was too careless and didnt take it seriously enough
      and didnt change I am sorry for that. I am Sorry for being so immature and dumb.But. now I have realised how bad it is 
      and this time I am sachmein working on my gussa like sachmein I am working on it,like this time I am trying 
      gussa control techniques to control my gussa, breathing techniques and stuff and also I am learning how to
      communicate ache se and calmly so that I dont end up accusing you or hurting you and it doesnt end up in an arguement like always,
      also I've learnt how much communication is important for a relationship and ways to communicate better.
      Also, I was toxic, I know so I have also learnt about how not to be toxic and I am overall learning how to be a better partner for you
      because I sachmein dont wanna lose you sachmein. I know it is too late to change everything, I am Sorry I couldnt do this phele 
      but this time I am sachmein doing it, not just trying, I am doing it sachmein I am making Progress I havent been gussa 
      since 3 days, I am working on myself and improving I have even analysed our relationship and figured out 
      what went wrong and ways to fix it so this time we can work it out in a better way.Sachmein Kashish, we are a strong couple
      we can make this work out, I know my gussa was the biggest problem I know that but this time I am doing it,not just trying this time
      I have sachmein gotten results this time, please Kashish I beg you let us try one last time, just one last time
      this will I pakka wala ikdam ikdam pakka wala wont fuck things up and get gussa, I know it will be hard changing will be hard
      but this time I am sachmein putting in my all.This time sachmein I mean it not like the other times, I know it is difficult for you to beleive me 
      because I have fucked up too many times in the past and I said the same thing again and again,but this time sachmein

      but please for everything we have ever had I beg you to give me one final chance please just one last.

      We were highschool sweethearts and Kashish we have to be one of the rare teenage relationships that work out not the ones that break up.
      I know I was very bad and I understand why you broke up and it wasnt like you immediately broke up, you waited a long time
      told me to change many times but I didnt channge even once, you were strong to bear to it for such a long time

      I promise you,It'll be worth it. Please one last time let me be your Kiwi again please , and this is sachmein last time, whatever your decision is I will respect it
      and if you want break up then I will go away from your life completely I promise but please one last time please
      just think about it please. I have worked very hard on this thing so please whatever your answer is please atleast unblock me and tell me ek baar
      and I just hope it is a yes. I am not forcing you into a relationship, we will take it slow if you want, I am just asking you one last time 
      no pressure, no forcing, whatever your decision will be I will respect it just make sure it is your own decision.
